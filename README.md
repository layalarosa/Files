READ FILE 

General explanation of the program flow:

Setting the CSV File Path: The program defines the location of a CSV file called Newsletter.csv, which is located in a specific folder on the computer.

Opening the File: The file is opened in read mode so that its contents can be accessed.

Reading the File Contents: The program reads the entire contents of the file and stores it in a variable. This allows all the information contained in the file to be processed.

Preparing an SQL Script: An SQL statement is started to be built to insert the data from the CSV file into a database. An INSERT INTO command is structured, which includes the table columns and values ​​to be inserted.

Processing and Adding the Data to the SQL Script: The program separates the contents of the file into lines and then, on each line, separates the data by commas. It then adds each value from the CSV file to the SQL script as if it were a value in a row of data to be inserted into the table.

Display Contents and Close Resources: Finally, the contents of the file are printed to the console and any open resources are closed to free up memory and prevent errors.

This program allows you to read data from a CSV file and convert it into an SQL insert command, which could be used to load that data into a database.


READ FILE FOR LOOP

This C# code is designed to read data from a CSV file and save it to a database using Entity Framework. Here is a general explanation of each step:

Define and Open CSV File: The path to the CSV file containing the data is specified. The file is then opened for reading, allowing its contents to be accessed.

Read File Contents: The entire file content is read and stored in a variable. The file is then processed line by line, where each line represents a data record.

Process and Prepare Data for Saving:

Each line is broken down into columns separated by commas.
From these columns, a NewsletterContact object (an entity in Entity Framework) is created and assigned values ​​such as name, email, and preferences.
Creation and update dates are assigned using the current date and time.
Save Data to Database: The data is added to the database context and immediately saved. This process is repeated for each line in the file.

Error Handling:

Each time a line is processed, the code handles any errors that may occur when reading or saving the data. If an error is found on any line, the program skips it and continues with the next one without stopping.
If any error occurs in the entire reading or connection process, it is captured and a message with the error is displayed.
Closing the File: After all the lines are processed, the file is closed to free up resources and ensure that they are not left open.

In summary, this code allows you to take a CSV file with contact data and save it to a database using Entity Framework. You must ensure that the CSV file is correctly formatted and that the database context (_context) is properly configured so that the data is stored correctly.
