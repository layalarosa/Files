READ FILE 

General explanation of the program flow:

Setting the CSV File Path: The program defines the location of a CSV file called Newsletter.csv, which is located in a specific folder on the computer.

Opening the File: The file is opened in read mode so that its contents can be accessed.

Reading the File Contents: The program reads the entire contents of the file and stores it in a variable. This allows all the information contained in the file to be processed.

Preparing an SQL Script: An SQL statement is started to be built to insert the data from the CSV file into a database. An INSERT INTO command is structured, which includes the table columns and values ​​to be inserted.

Processing and Adding the Data to the SQL Script: The program separates the contents of the file into lines and then, on each line, separates the data by commas. It then adds each value from the CSV file to the SQL script as if it were a value in a row of data to be inserted into the table.

Display Contents and Close Resources: Finally, the contents of the file are printed to the console and any open resources are closed to free up memory and prevent errors.

This program allows you to read data from a CSV file and convert it into an SQL insert command, which could be used to load that data into a database.
